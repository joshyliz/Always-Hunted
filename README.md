# Always-Hunted
A mod for The Long Dark that makes it so that you are always hunted by a bear

How to install:
===============
1. Download and install "Melon Loader" by HerpDerpinstine
https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/
This creates a new folder named "Mods" in your TLD folder.

2. Download and extract everything from the releases ZIP file to your new TLD\Mods folder
   
3. Start the game!

# How it works
This mod is The Hunted Challenge Part 1 but in survival mode, so you can get the rifle and access places that are blocked in the regular challenge.

# How to customize
Since the ModSettings mod broke there is now just a json file in the mod folder that you can config.

The file is call "BearSettings.json" if its not there start the game and one should be made.
If you don't know what mod folder I am talking about its the same folder you dragged the Always Hunted.dll into.

Change what you want, save the file then hit F7 and go into and out of a building to reload the changed settings.

There are 4 things you can change in the settings you can change in the file:
1. MinimumSpawnDistance | This is the minimum distance the bear can spawn from you. | The defualt is 75.
2. MaximumSpawnDistance | This is the minimum distance the bear can spawn from you. | The defualt is 200.
3. BearIsEnabled | If true the bear will spawn if false the bear will not spawn. | Default is true
4. BearEnabledInFRBL | If true the bear can spawn in the far range branch line region. The reason you are able to disable this is because the bear is really buggy in this region. | Defualt is true

# !Warning
If the bear gets stuck somewhere it is not the mod's fault, the bear even in the official challenge is a little buggy.
