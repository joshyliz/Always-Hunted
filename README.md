# Always-Hunted
A mod for The Long Dark that makes it so that you are always hunted by a bear

How to install:
===============
1. Download and install "Melon Loader" by HerpDerpinstine
https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/
This creates a new folder named "Mods" in your TLD folder.

2. Download and extract everything from the releases ZIP file to your new TLD\Mods folder
   
3. Start the game!

# How it works
This mod is The Hunted Challenge Part 1 but in survival mode, so you can get the rifle and access places that are blocked in the regular challenge.

Since the ModSettings mod broke there is now just a json file in the mod folder that you can config. Hit F7 to reload the changed settings.

# !Warning
If the bear gets stuck somewhere it is not the mod's fault, the bear even in the official challenge is a little buggy.
